# Odin-recipes

An imaginary website project for resurrecting the dinosaurs.

This project is designed to show basic HTML and git skills:

- Creating a project in github.  
- Cloning the repository onto the local computer to work on.  
- Setting up a website directory and file structure  
- Writing HTML boilerplate.  
- Using HTML to Create a homepage with links to different pages.  
- Using HTML for basic formatting, images and lists  
- making git commits.  
- pushing the project to github.  

The project was supposed to be basic food recipes, but I thought recipes for making dinosaurs would be more fun... because it is.
